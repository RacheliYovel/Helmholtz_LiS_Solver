Questions:
    - Not sure I understand why the convolution of Green's function and the source matrix is our solution we seek for.
    - Why is g_temp of size 2n*2n? 
      I understand that with the padding of q we will get the isolation (like non-periodic BC) - but does it have to be of this size? 
      Why not smaller?
    - Green's function is practically (Hop)^-1 (only the middle column of it).
